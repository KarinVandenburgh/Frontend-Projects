    <h1> THE HISTORY OF MINIONS</h1>
    <p> One day, the Minions accidentally activated a time machine in their underground lab, 
        sending Kevin, Stuart, and Bob into a future ruled by a tyrannical robot named Xortron. 
        Teaming up with a young inventor named Luna, they embarked on a hilarious adventure to 
        steal an energy crystal needed to fix the timeline. With their usual mix of chaos and 
        cleverness—plus a well-timed banana distraction—they escaped Xortron's fortress and 
        returned to the present. Back in their lab, the Minions celebrated, ready for their next 
        mischievous adventure.
