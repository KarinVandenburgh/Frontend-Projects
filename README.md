# Web Projects Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains five front-end web projects created with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Each project is stored in its own folder and can be opened directly in a browser. The goal of this portfolio is to showcase creative logic, interactivity, and responsive web design.

## How to Run These Projects Locally

To make sure your browser correctly loads all **media**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** files, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Download the full repository**
   - Click the blue **“Code”** button above → **“Download ZIP”**
   - Unzip the folder on your computer
   - If needed click "Extract all" if the folder turns up empty then all the files will show up

2. **Keep the folder structure intact**
   - Do **not** move `index.html` out of its folder
   - Keep the `js/`, `css/`, and `media/` folders together inside the project folder

3. **Open the HTML file**
   - Right-click the `index.html` file → **Open With → Browser**
   - Or drag the file directly into your browser window
4. Once the file is open you can interact with the program!
